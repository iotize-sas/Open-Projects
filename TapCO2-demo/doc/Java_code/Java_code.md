## Java code

The `Java` code embedded in the `JVM` will allow us to make a `onCheck()` method call every time (This time is defined in a `TapNLinkVar` constructor). In this onCheck() method, by verifying that the passed `id` corresponds to the desired one, we will be able to perform data recovery tasks and also `TapNLinkVar` value updates or send MQTT message.
